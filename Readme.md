#Bank-App Project overview 
This Bank application simulates the same functionalities
used in the real-world ones.
The user to be able to access the application, by using
the credentials listed within the users={} that can be found at the top of the code.
The user can also have the option to change their
password through the forgot password option.
Once inside the application the user is able to use the 
application like a normal real-life basic bank app.
The user interface is user-friendly to  allow the user to use the application 
without any problem.
Some other functionalities that are include are:
*Adding a new payee
The user is able to add a new payee to list of the existing ones by entering their details 
*Transaction history
After each transaction the transaction history wil update displaying all the latest transaction details.
*Bank balance
The user will be able to see the balance that then updates after every transaction

For this project I made use of both Python and PywebIO for the logic and interface of the application.
